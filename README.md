# A simple(not) Next.js Blog

I've been trying to build this some time now. Already amazed by the capabilities of Next.js, I decided to give it a try. We have some kind of result (I guess) but of course it can always get better.

Backend is set up with GraphCMS so if you want to use it just put your credentials in .env and set up your profile in the CMS as the API endpoint and you are ready!

It was actually inspired by [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmXmlB4-HJytD7wek0Uo97A) ®️ on Youtube. 
## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/georgekakarlis/next-js-blog-test.git
cd   next-js-blog-test
npm install
```
### 2. Set up GraphCMS account and project credentials in .env. They are included in .gitignore file so you have to create one by yourself.
### 3. Start the application

To run your site locally, use:

```
npm run dev
```

To run it in production mode, use:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```
